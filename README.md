# Movie library ASP.NET CSharp

The project implements a movie database in ASP.NET environment using C# language. I use Razor pages for the user interface of the pages. The whole program consists of a client and a server side. We can only perform operations in the program after logging in. You can log in to the project with Facebook, Google and Azure AD B2C login. Azure login also includes registration and sending a forgotten password email.

I store movies, actors, and genres in the program. You can create, edit, and delete copies of all three. You can sort movies and actors in the table according to their different data. You can also filter movies by genre and can also search for movies by title and actors by name.
